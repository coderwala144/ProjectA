            <p><strong>DESCRIPTION: <br></strong>
                Wheat is a grass widely cultivated for its seed, a cereal grain that is a staple food around the world.
                <li>The many species of wheat together make up the genus Triticum (/ˈtrɪtɪkəm/);[3] the most widely
                    grown is common wheat (T. aestivum).</li>
                <li>The archaeological record suggests that wheat was first cultivated in the regions of the Fertile
                    Crescent around 9600 BC.</li>
                <li>Botanically, the wheat kernel is a caryopsis, a type of fruit.</li><br>
                Wheat is grown on a larger area of land than any other food crop (220.7 million hectares or 545 million
                acres in 2021). World trade in wheat is greater than for all other crops combined. In 2021, world wheat
                production was 771 million tonnes (850 million short tons), making it the second most-produced cereal
                after maize (known as corn in North America and Australia; wheat is often called corn in countries
                including Britain).[4] Since 1960, world production of wheat and other grain crops has tripled and is
                expected to grow further through the middle of the 21st century. Global demand for wheat is increasing
                because of the usefulness of gluten to the food industry.
                Wheat is an important source of carbohydrates. Globally, it is the leading source of vegetable proteins
                in human food, having a protein content of about 13%, which is relatively high compared to other major
                cereals but relatively low in protein quality (supplying essential amino acids). When eaten as the whole
                grain, wheat is a source of multiple nutrients and dietary fiber. In a small part of the general
                population, gluten – which comprises most of the protein in wheat – can trigger coeliac disease,
                noncoeliac gluten sensitivity, gluten ataxia, and dermatitis
            </p>
